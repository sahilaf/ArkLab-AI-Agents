## üìã Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or above)  
- Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials (for Google login)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arklab-ai-agents.git
   cd arklab-ai-agents

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Create .env.local at project root with:**
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-string

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

5. **Open in browser:**
Visit http://localhost:3000



## üé® Key Design Decisions & Challenges

### Next.js App Router & SSR
- Leveraged React Server Components for initial data fetching of AI agents, ensuring the content is SEO-friendly by rendering on the server.

### Authentication with NextAuth.js
- Integrated Google OAuth alongside a mock credentials provider for demo purposes.
- Managed session state with `SessionProvider` and secure redirects for smooth UX.

### Client-side Filtering & State Management
- Used Redux to manage filters and agent state, ensuring responsive UI updates without full page reloads.

### Animations
- Used Framer Motion for subtle UI polish, like card hover effects, enhancing user experience without overwhelming.

### Challenge
- Handling redirect behavior post-login was tricky due to NextAuth‚Äôs callback URL handling with the Next.js App Router.
- Setting `callbackUrl` explicitly and `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable solved this.

## üîê Google OAuth 2.0 Integration

- Used the [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) library‚Äôs `GoogleProvider` for OAuth.
- Created OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console with redirect URI:  
  `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Stored credentials securely in `.env.local`.
- Managed session with NextAuth‚Äôs JWT strategy.
- Handled sign-in redirects by passing `callbackUrl: "/"` to `signIn()` calls.
- **Note:** Since this is a demo, user persistence is not implemented; all Google logins are accepted without database checks.

## üìù Future Improvements

- Add database integration (e.g., Prisma + PostgreSQL) to persist users and AI agents.
- Implement full user sign-up flow, user profiles, and secure route protection.
- Enhance filtering with multi-select and better UX.
- Add unit and integration tests.
